# CelesteTasLanguage

This project is in pre-pre-pre-alpha. Don't expect things to keep working or for it to be like useable.

Currently the the variables the code can access from celeste are hardcoded, edit them in 
InfoResponceParsing.hs (named: exampleVariables)

The location to store the tas files send to celeste are also hardcoded, edit it in
IOUnitActions.hs (named: tasSaveFile)

To edit the tas edit the file code/exampleProgram.ptas

There is no good documentation yet. :/
